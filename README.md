# Assignment 1 

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `dat`: the folder that contains all the vaccination data
- `docs`: the folder to contain all generated javadoc output 

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
